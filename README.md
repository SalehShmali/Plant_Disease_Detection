## Plant Disease Detection
Plant Disease Detection is one of the mind boggling issue that exits when we talk about using Technology in Agriculture.
this project has been done to detect weather a plant is healthy or diseased using Deep Learning and with the help of Neural Network

## About the dataset
The dataset used for this project has been taken from Plant-Village- Dataset which can be found [here](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset/tree/master/raw/color/).

## Result
